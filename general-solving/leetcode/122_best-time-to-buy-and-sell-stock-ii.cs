* Problem Name: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
* Problem URL : https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/
* Date        : Nov 17 2015
* Complexity  : O(n) Time, O(1) space
* Author      : Atiq Rahman
* Status      : Accepted
* Notes       : Look at example for better understanding how this solution progresses
*                Sub-problems (intervals) actually depend, after we find first interval
*                that's when we know where second interval starts. So even though across an
*                interval though max, min are not dependent, this is still a dynamically progressing
*                solution.
* 
*                Thanks Md Abdul Kader (Sreezin) for his opinion on the analysis on this part.
