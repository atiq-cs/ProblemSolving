* Title : Delete Node in a BST
* URL   : https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst
* Date  : 2018-01-06
* Author: Atiq Rahman
* Comp  : O(h), h = lg n
* Status: Accepted
* Notes : Took a few attempts to get it right.
*   I considered following cases during implementation,
*   - z has no left child
*   - z has no right child
*   - z has both children
*   - z is root of the Tree
*   * y might have no children; y's right should point to z's right subtree
*   - node z containing value k is not found (applicable to this problem)
*   
*   After first few versions of implementation got TLE. Reason behind TLE is
*   wrong wiring of node's pointers which created cycle. Therefore, judge's
*   program would not terminate in time. There is no language specific time
*   limit inconsistency for this problem.
*   
*   I used solution of chuan-shuo-xuan-shou
*   https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/discuss/93296 to verify
*   time constraint.
*   
*  TREE-SUCCESSOR (C.L.R p292):
*   Simple version of TREE-SUCCESSOR(x); x.right is not NIL is demonstrated
*   below. Due to the simplified application TREE-SUCCESSOR could not be fully
*   tested with this leetcode problem.
*   
*   Transplant(T, u, v) [C.L.R p296] is not implemented as a function due to
*   requirement of passing of additional parameters. For an independent
*   function it might require following parameters,
*   - parent of z
*   - z
*   - parent of successor y
*   - successor y
*   Additionally, based on conditions root of the Tree might need to be updated
*   
*   There are a few inputs in the input text file added as well. Variations of
*   the small input were useful. Large one is added for reference only.
