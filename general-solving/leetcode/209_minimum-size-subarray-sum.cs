* Title : Minimum Size Subarray Sum
* URL   : https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/
* Date  : 2015-07-25
* Author: Atiq Rahman
* Comp  : O(n)
* Status: Accepted
* Notes : Sliding window approach - utilize given that input numbers are
*   positive. kadane algorithm is not right approach to find min subarray
*   length. kadane works great for maximizing sum not minimizing length based
*   on a given sum.
*   
*   This algorithm is suitable when given set of numbers are positive.
*   Example illustrated at the bottom of this source file.
*   i is end of current Window.
*   startIndex is start of current Window.
*
*   Calling it sliding windows approach; not clear about the pattern 'sweeping'
*   algorithm (C.L.R.S 3 ed, p1021) follows yet.

i=0,

i=2,
 flag = false; sum = 5 + 1 = 6
i=3,
 flag = true; sum = 6 + 2 = 8
 8 >= 7? Yes. Keep removing items from starting of the window
 1 item {2} is removed,
  startIndex becomes 1
  sum becomes 6
  min = 3 - 1 + 2 = 4
i=4,
 flag = true; sum = 6 + 4 = 10
 10 >= 7? Yes. Keep removing items from starting of the window
 2 items {3, 1} are removed,
  startIndex becomes 3
  sum becomes 6
  min = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
i=5,
 flag = true; sum = 6 + 3 = 9
 9 >= 7? Yes. Keep removing items from starting of the window
 2 items {2, 4} are removed,
  startIndex becomes 5
  sum becomes 3
  min = 5 - 5 + 2 = 2

As we can see last two elements, {4, 3} makes the minimum length subarray for
this solution.
