/* Example inputs,
"aa"
"aa"

"ABCABC"
"CAB"

and draft initial,
Try KMP alike approach..

abbccbbabc

all we need is unique set cover,
{a, b, c}

 - we get a new one we add
 - we get one that we already have

say we got,
i=0,
a

coverCount = 1

i=1,
ab
coverCount = 2

i=2,
abb
coverCount = 2

i=3,
abbc
len = 4
coverCount = 3

first time we got a cover..

i=4,
abbcc
len = 5
coverCount = 3

i=5,
abbccb
len = 6
coverCount = 3
try to trim first part where prev b was found..

i=6,
abbccbb
len = 7
coverCount = 3
try to trim first part where prev b was found..

i=7,
abbccbba
len = 7
coverCount = 3
try to trim first part where prev b was found..

exact KMP cannot be applied

How to know where to default back?

say we also have count stuff for each char encountered..

can't fill n^2 space with o(n) algorithm..

What I have though is O(26) at each index... to check and know everything we want..

at any index I can do constant number of comparisons and tell whether we have a cover..

question is how do we choose the indices..

- till we have not covered we keep adding..

can I tell if have any cover in O(N)? yes..

need a good algorithm for backing up... the way KMP backs up to start matching from where it matters..

how can we do that for this problem??

abbccbbabc

after a cover is found removing first char.. keep removing them as long as ..
abbccbba becomes cbba


simply saying,
after a cover is found.. try to find a cover removing its first char..

abbcaabbcc

And draft second,
----------
Input: S = "ADOBECODEBANC", T = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"

ADOBEC
ADOBECODEBA
found match now reduce
CODEBA
CODEBANC
found match now reduce
BANC

is this an efficient way of rolling back?

because 

say we keep just a count..

feels like we have a dictionary we can utilize frequency count

ADOBECODEBANC
ABC
