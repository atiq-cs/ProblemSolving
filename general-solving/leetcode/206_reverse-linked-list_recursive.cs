/***************************************************************************
* Problem Name: Reverse Linked List (recursive solution)
* Problem URL : https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/
* Derived from: Algorithms/Recursion_Reverse_Linked_List_demo.cpp
 
* Date        : July 29, 2015
* Desc        : uses the idea that all the nodes of the linked list are pushed into heap during recursive
*   calls. So when we are return from those calls use the store nodes to change the link each time
*   - This however, does changes head's next
*   - To keep track of the head we have to use global head
*   - we need to take care of the case when head.next is null in the recursive function
*   - if head is null RecReverse function does nothing so we don't set its next to null as we do
*     in regular cases
*
* Complexity  : O(n)
* Author      : Atiq Rahman
* Status      : Accepted (0.160s)
* Note        : All classes are assigned and passed to functions by reference whereas structures
*   copies the object
*   For more tech notes look at: 206_reverse-linked-list_recursive.cs

    // this point, all of the nodes till this one is already in stack. We won't
