* Title : Sort Characters By Frequency
* URL   : https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency
* Date  : 2018-06-07
* Author: Atiq Rahman
* Comp  : O(n), O(N)
* Status: Accepted
* Notes : Given data is unsorted.
*   if input was only chars (lower and upper)
*     limit = 'z'-'A'+1
*   and, starting index would be,
*     i-'A'
*
*   input can contain numbers as well. Then I change to offset with '0'.
*   Then I found input contains space as well. Therefore, adjusted offset with
*   ' '.
*   
*   For most optimized solution we would need additional O(N) space to maintain
*   the mapping
