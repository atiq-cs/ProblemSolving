/***************************************************************************
* Title : Subsets II
* URL   : https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii
* Date  : 2018-08-15
* Author: Atiq Rahman
* Occasn: InnoWorld old, Charan
* Comp  : O(N * 2^n), O(N * 2^n)
* Status: Accepted
* Notes : Adapted from 78 - subsets 
*   Here we got,
*    k = ssindex[q]
*
*   Space comp: Each combination can hold N items hence complexity i
*   Time comp: The way I was filling up adding one item to previous subset each
*   time.. I thought it's O(1) for each of them.. I totally missed that I am
*   copying entire old subset to new one before adding. That's where O(N) is
*   cost every time.
*
*  ToDo : implement recursive solution
* Ack   : Md Abdul Kader (Sreezin) for handling dupicates with i==k
* meta  : tag-leetcode-medium
