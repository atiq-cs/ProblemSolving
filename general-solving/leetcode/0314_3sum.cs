* Title : 3Sum
* URL   : https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum
* Date  : 2018-03
* Author: Atiq Rahman
* Comp  : O(N^2), space constant considering we are allowed to modify original
*   array for one time sorting
* Status: Accepted
* Notes : Given data is unsorted.
*   If we develop an algorithm that has a run-time complexity of O(N^2) or
*   larger asymptotic complexity in that case, we can sort the data which takes
*   O(n lg n)
*   Therefore, solution basically boils down to,
*   - Utilize sorted data structure
*   - Handle duplicates
*   
*   As we take advantage of sorted data we don't need additional space for the
*   hash table data structure. My initial idea was to use a hash table that
*   takes around O(N * N * lg N) using hash table on the unsorted data.
*   However, this sliding window approach for this problem is better than that.

*   ref: https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/discuss/7380/Concise-O(N2)-Java-
*     solution (an easy to understand solution kinda similar thinking as mine
*     for this problem)

/* Draft
if I had two numbers and I had to find pairs which sum to 0..
Later consider there are duplicates.

Can we use 2sum to solve 3-sum?
two sum can tell how many ways we can make 0-A[i]

How to solve two sum when there are duplicates?
keeping a hashset does not give me unique solution any more..

Sort first
for every number in the list do,
sum = 0 - num;
then,
 low = i +1; high = n-1;


Naive O(n^2); iterate over indices
HashSet of HashSet; output values order 
solved later using two pointers approach following a leetcode solution idea
 
Some cases considered to handle while developing the solution,
[-2,0,1,1,2]
[0,0,0]
[-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
