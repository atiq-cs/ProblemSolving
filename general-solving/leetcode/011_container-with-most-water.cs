* Title : Container With Most Water
* URL   : https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water
* Occas : JS Meetup Arrays and Strings 2014-08-18
* Date  : 201-04-18
* Author: Atiq Rahman
* Comp  : O(N), Space Constant Time O(1)
* Status: Accepted
* Notes : Sliding window approach (unsorted input data)
*   Why does it work? Why would not we miss a solution especially when input
*   data is not sorted?
*
*   Basically you are just trying to find the furthest taller edge the current
*   one [i] can reach - a further but slightly taller edge, is better than a
*   huge tall edge that is closer, since the max container is limited by each
*   edge [i] itself - being the shorter edge. If [i] is the tallest, it can
*   form no containers with its height.
*   
*   Two-pointers solution, walking from each end, guarantees the shorter edge
*   meets its furthest taller edge. Simple as that.
