*   Run time analysis,
*    Push and pop operations on the Stack takes constant time, O(1).
*    Implemented algorithm iterates over each character of the string.
*    For each char, the algorithm checks if the character is an opening brace
*    in constant time. If it is then the char is pushed into the stack in
*    constant time. Otherwise, a char is popped from the Stack and compared.
*    While doing this if the Stack is found empty or char does not match then,
*    algorithm returns false. In best case, the algorithm returns false right
*    after observing the first char.
*    Therefore, for each char it takes constant time. Overall time complexity,
*    in worst case, is, O(n)
*    
*   Space complexity analysis, 
*    In worst case the stack might contain O(n) items. This worst case can be
*    produced by a string containing all left/opening braces.

*   If we are allowed to modify original string we can keep removing valid
*   sequences. In the end, if string is empty then it's valid. Here's an
*   example, (()). First we removed (), the string becomes (). We remove that
*   and we end up with empty string.
