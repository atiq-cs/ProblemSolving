* Title : Rotate List
* URL   : https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list
* Date  : 2018-06-07
* Author: Atiq Rahman
* Comp  : O(n), O(1)
* Status: Accepted
* Notes : There are two ways to solve this problem.
*   1. Copying the values from old positions in the linked list into the new
*   positions.
*   2. Modifying the links of the linked list.
*   
*   Considering method#1,
*   let's calculate source and destination pointer indices,
*   After rotating right by k places,
*   0th index becomes k-th index
*   1st index becomes 3rd index
*   
*   when k>=n
*   i becomes i + (k%n) 
*   
*   2 pointers: 1 pointer to the destination and 1 to source

*   source starts from head
*   destination starts from head + k%n
*   
*   This is a bad idea considering value on destination pointer is being
*   written and being lost. If we try to save that one by advancing pointer
*   again by k... this situation continues like a leep.. This seems rather
*   complex! On the other hand, retaining these values would require additional
*   space while advancing those pointers
*   
*   Therefore, we go with approach#2 which is pretty straight-forward.
