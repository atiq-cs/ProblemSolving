* Title : Top K Frequent Words
* URL   : https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words
* Date  : 2018-03-10
* Author: Atiq Rahman
* Comp  : O(n lg n), space O(n)
* Status: Accepted
* Notes : Linq query is to do the n lg n sorting
*   If we solve this without using LINQ one way to do it would be to implement
*   a comparator to do sorting considering following cases,
*   - sort in descending order of frequency of words
*   - when there is a tie for frequency sort lexicographically
*
*   Amazon's coding test version of this problem asks to implement similar
*   sorting however required comparison is case insensitive. It also asks to
*   exclude words from a given list.
