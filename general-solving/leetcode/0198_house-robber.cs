/*
Consider following example,
2, 5, 1, 7, 6, 3

max from robbing first houses 1,
2

max from robbing first houses 2,
two houses are adjacent, only one of them can be robbed
max(2, 5) = 5

max from robbing first houses 3,
max(5, 1+2) = 5

max from robbing first houses 4,
7 + max of first 2

max profit from n
p[n-1] = max(h[n-1] + p[n-3], p[n-2])
