Found draft in a cpp solution
-----------------------------
abcdefgh

I try to find starting from last index from where it is not sorted in descending order
we reach to h
since there is nothing after h, we do the post swap operation
and then we swap h with g
result is abcdefhg

abcdefhg
we reach to f after which things are not sorted in descending order
swap g with h and then g with f

abcdegfh

reach to h
result is 
abcdeghf

now reach to g
abc
acb
bac



Analyzing the permutation problem
1, 2, 3 [swap index 1 with 1]
1, 3, 2 [swap index 2 with 3]
2, 1, 3 [swap index 1 with 2]
2, 3, 1
3, 1, 2
3, 2, 1

analyzing next permutation,
1, 2, 3, 4

iterate from reverse direction and find the first one that is smaller than next one
consider example, 4 3 2 1
 if length becomes 0, reverse the string
 example results
 1, 2, 3, 4
