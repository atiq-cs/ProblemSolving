/*
  Following to be noted regarding problem desc,
   - Reverse a linked list and return pointer to the head
   - The input list will have at least one element
   - Node is defined as 
      struct Node
      {
       int data;
       struct Node *next;
      }
*/

  // Complete this method
  // starting from head all the nodes next pointer has to be changed
  if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL)
    return head;

  // for head next should be set to NULL
  Node* cur_node = head->next;
  Node* pre_node = head;
