* Complexity  : O(n)
* Author      : Atiq Rahman
* Status      : Accepted
* Notes       : Traditional Sum = Sum(A[i]) for i=0..N
*   To maximize we have to consider two values for each A[i],
*   1 and B[i]. I consider 1 as the low value and B[i] as the
*   high value. However, B[i] can be 1 as well.
*   
*   To build this DP it helps to consider outcome for each item
*   with both high and low value (1 and B[i].
*   
*   There is no outcome with 1 item. So,
*    s[0][LOW] and s[0][HIGH] are both 0;
*    
*   Considering current value of A[i] to be low (1): then we have 2
*   cases:
*   1. Previous one: A[i-1] is low. In that case,
*    s[i][low] = s[i-1][low] + 1 -1 = s[i-1][low]
*   2. Previous one: A[i-1] is high. So,
*    s[i][low] = s[i-1][high] + b[i-1] -1
*
*   Finally, we take the value that maximizes,
*    s[i][low] = Max( sum1, sum2 );
*    
*    However, there is no gain in choosing s[i-1][low]
*    We get more when we do, s[i-1][high] + b[i-1] -1
*   This works given that B[i] >= 0
*   Therefore, more we can accumulate the more it maximizes the
*   result.
*   
*   it is the sum of A[i-1] to be
*    s[i][LOW] = s[i - 1][HIGH] + b[i-1] - 1;
*    
*   This could also be solved using three variable that keep track
*   of previous 2 values for s[i-1]
*   The use of array in the solution looks okay for recurrence.
