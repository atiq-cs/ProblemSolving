* Title       : The Coin Change Problem

* Notes       : 
*               The goal is to find number of ways coins can sum up to n. 
*               By trying the regular DP concept, I was able to
*               write the algo/solution that can compute number of ways
*               However, because the coin iteration loop was inner
*               it included solutions where order of coins mattered or
*               position of the coins mattered. To give an example,
*               consider 3 coins are given to make sum 4 like following,
*               
*               4 3
*               1 2 3
*               solutions are considered:
*                1 1 1 1
*                1 1 2
*                1 2 1
*                2 1 1
*                1 3
*                2 2
*                3 1
*               which gives us total ways = 7
*               
*               To include only the unique solutions all we need to do is put
*               the coin loop as outer
*               
*               Lessons:
*                sorting coins not necessary
*                
*               Initialization:
*                How many ways can we make 0?
*                1 (known and does not require further calculation)
*                How many ways can we make others?
*                Initialize with 0 and dynamically keep adding to find final value.
*               Therefore, initialization goes as follows,
*                Set count for making 0 to 1
*                And, all others to 0.
*

1, 2, 3

cw[1] = 1
cw[2] = 1
cw[3] = 1

how many ways can we make 0?
1

how many ways can we make 1?
cw[1] + 1 coin = 1


how many ways can we make 2?
for each coin c_i
 cw[2] += c_i

how many ways can we make n?
for each coin c_i
 cw[n] += cw[n-c_i]

consider example,
{1, 2, 3} 
cw[0] = 1
cw[1] += cw[0] = 1
cw[2] += cw[1] = 1
cw[2] += cw[0] = 2
cw[3] += cw[2] = 2
cw[3] += cw[1] = 3
cw[3] += cw[0] = 4

{1, 1, 1}
{1, 2}
{3}

add 1
{1, 1}
{2}
add 2
{1}

3 3
1 2 3

tries the first coin,
1
3-1=2
cw[3] += cw[2]

first we try to make 1
cw[1] = 1

we try to make 2
cw[2] +=  cw[2-1] = cw[1] = 1
cw[2] +=  cw[2-2] = cw[0] = 2

we try to make 3
cw[3] +=  cw[3-1] = cw[2] = 2
cw[3] +=  cw[3-2] = cw[1] = 3

some how use

we wanna allow use of the same coin but not 
we wanna allow {1, 2} but not {2, 1}

or 1, 1, 2 but not 1, 2, 1
can use hashset for each number, complexity of comparison 

this set operations getting complex hashset won't work cuz we might have
duplicate values
