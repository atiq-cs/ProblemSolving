* Title : Union of Doubly Linked Lists
* URL   : http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/847/A
* Contst: 2017-2018 ACM-ICPC NEERC, Southern Subregional Contest, qualification
* Date  : 2018-04-22
* Author: Atiq Rahman
* Comp  : O(N)
* Status: Accepted
* Notes : This is not really a good problem for practicing implementation of
*   doubly linked list. Building LinkedList is not trivial since nodes are out
*   of order.. we can say this place for practicing alternative doubly linked
*   list representation.

*   Pragmatically, I use a representation similar to the input. To do this we
*   use an array of nodes which can be accessed by index and have properties,
*   previous and next.
*   First thought that came to mind is to find groups from the input. Each
*   group represents a list. Then, it looks like only having the list of heads
*   for a group suffices.
*   
*   Observations,
*   - nodes having 0 as previous are heads
*   - nodes having 0 as next are tails
*   
*   Since the order of joining the lists doesn't matter we can start with each
*   list and reach to tail. Every time we reach tail we update the next of tail
*   and previous for next head.
* meta  : tag-linked-list, tag-easy
