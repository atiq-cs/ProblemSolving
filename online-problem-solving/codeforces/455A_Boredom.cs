*   Date        : Dec 18, 2016
*   Occasion    : Codeforces Round #260 (Div. 1)

*   Author      : Atiq Rahman
*   Status      : Accepted (78ms)
*   Notes       : Linear DP
*     The way better way to read this problem is,
*     if we delete a number x from the sequence we have to delete all (x-1) and
*     (x+1) as well.

*     final solution is developed by accruing upon previous solutions for
*     example how many points can I make using n numbers depend upon max points
*     made by n-1 numbers or n-2 numbers
*                 
*     Alternate solution
*       Runs a 10^5 loop

 draft
 Maximizing total points will depend on the following,
1 2 1 3 2 2 2 2 3
if we start with first 1
we have to delete all 2s
which gives us 
score =1 
but will lose all 2s that is a bad idea so,

let's delete the first 2
which gives us,
3 2 2 2 2 3

score = 2
now let's delete 2 again

score = 4

1 2 1 3 2 2 2 2 3

strategy: start with a number x where (x-1) and (x+1) is not very frequent?
or start with a number which is most frequent..

1 2
if frequency is same start with the one that is bigger


1 2 3
start with 3

how much can we get with a_k?
if we get a_k
 how much do we lose?

 
Naive solution: we find frequency of each of the numbers
Why does my solution look like greedy??

Because it is indeed greedy

1 2 1 3 2 2 2 2 3

After sorting
1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3

lose 1 
and we have,
1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3

count is really easy..
for each number we know,
we can get n_i * a_i where 

let's create a complicated case,
2 2 2 3 3

if it's equal taking any of those is fine...

1 1 2 2 2 3 3
now if take 
find total damange done by each number x,
s[x-1] + s[x+1]

score(x) = f[x] * x
damage(x) = s[x-1] + s[x+1]

old draft
-------------
1 2 1 3 2 2 2 2 3

* greedy appraoch like taking the highest score yielding item each time might not work
but considering the max of 

Can there be like chain reaction?
like we have to go through all of them to find max score?

keep a previous max and accrue upon that..

say we got all of them s where s stands for score for each number,

considering all of these are consecutive,

s[i] = max(s[i-2], s[i-2]) + s[i]

result max(s[n-1], s[n-2])

now let's consider they are not consecutive,

1 2 3 5 6

max_score gets a reset whenever an interval is discovered

why are we getting 16?
