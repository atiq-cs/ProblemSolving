/***************************************************************************
* Title : Flipping Game
* URL   : http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/327/A
* Occasn: Codeforces Round #191 (Div. 2)
* Date  : 2017-09-02
* Author: Atiq Rahman
* Comp  : O(n) 122ms, Space O(n)
* Status: Accepted
* Notes : According problem description, we are allowed to do single move:
*   choose i and j, in-between these all indices (inclusive) are flipped.
*   The goal of the game is that after exactly one move to obtain the maximum
*   number of ones.
*   
*   This problem might had also been presented in JS meetup,
*   Contest Editorial: http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/8274 provides
*    hints on two approaches: O(n^3) and O(n)
*   Unbeknownst to me, I have implemented the second appraoch.
*   
*   Also appeared in JS meetup in 2018, Q1

/* Alternative costly thoughts:
We are losing solutions when using wrong conditions. We could accumulate from
previous sum and could go toward better result..

Let's think simple DP,
Say, s[i] contains the max that can be done by flipping 

s[1][1] = bit[0]
s[1][2] = s[1][1] + s[2][2]
s[1][i] = s[1][i] + s[i][]
s[1][n] = ?

0 0 0

can,
 s[1][i] can be 
  s[1][i-1] + 1   if bit[i] can be made from 0 to 1 or it is a 1

for i=1 to n,
 s[1][n] = max(s[1][n], s[1][i] + s[i+1][n]);

it should take an n*n loop to find upto,
then just take the max..

s[1][1] = bits[1]? 0:1;
s[1][2] = 
s[i][j] = max all s[i][k] + s[k][j];

we need to find,
s[1][n]

for this we need all following values,
s[1][2]
s[1][3]
s[1][4]
...
s[1][n-1]

and..
s[2][n]
s[3][n]
s[4][n]
......
s[n][n]


s[1][1] = toggle of bit[0]
s[1][2] = s[1][1] + ?


0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 1

[1][1] = 1
[1][2] = [1][1] + 1
[1][3] = [1][2] because previous bit is 0
