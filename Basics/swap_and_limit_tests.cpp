*  Desc    :  All things swap (testing overflow with approaches)
*          Approach 1: using temporary variable
*          Approach 2: using X-OR
*          Approach 3: using Subtraction and addition
*          Approach 4: using multiplication and division
*
*          Test environment: Visual Studio 2013
