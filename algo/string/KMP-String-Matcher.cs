* Title : String Matching Algorithm - Knuth�Morris�Pratt
* Date  : 2018-06-30 (update)
* Author: Atiq Rahman
* Comp  : O(m+n)
* Status: Demo
* Notes : Build Prefix Table and use the prefix table to find length of the
*   common substring between needle and haystack string.
* 
*   Each index of the prefix table keeps track of the previous index from
*   where it should start matching again when a mismatch is found.
*   
*   Explanation of 'ComputePrefix' method,
*   In summary, steps for each char during iteration,
*   1. Did it match?
*   Revert k back to a previous index.
*   2. Did it match now?
*   Move forward k to next index.
*   3. Set previous of current char's index to where k pointing now
*   
*   Please note that, till a char is matched with first char of the string k
*   is < 0 and first step is never executed. After the first match second step
*   is executed and k is moved forward.
*   
*   For example,
*    we consider the pattern string: "abcabcac"
*     
*   Previous of first index would be,
*     prefix[0] = -1,            'a', k = -1    
*     prefix[1] = -1,            'b'
*     prefix[2] = -1,            'c'
*     prefix[3] =  0,            'a', k = 0
*    This is the first time a match is found with first index; k moves forward.
*    First step, now comes into effect. Because it matches now it goes to
*    second step which moves k forward.
*     prefix[4] = 1,            'b'
*     prefix[5] = 2,            'c'
*     prefix[6] = 3,            'a', k = 3
*    i=7, now 4 and 7 does not match. k reverts back to pf[3] = 0 (points to 'a')
*    still 1 and 7 does not match. k doesn't move forward.
*     prefix[7] = 0
*   
*   'KMPStringMatcher' works similarly. However it does not modify prefix
*   table.
