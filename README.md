### Searching on the Repository
To implement searching based on tags we added meta to each of the source file. During search have to
append `tag-` as prefix of the tag string. For example, to search on problems on linked-list: we
navigate to [this repo url](https://github.com/atiq-cs/Problem-Solving/) and enter following in the
search box: `tag-ds-linked-list`

Additionally, here are currently supported tags/classifications based on algorithm and data
structure,
 * [Bit Manipulation](https://github.com/atiq-cs/Problem-Solving/search?q=tag-bit-manip)

#### Tag Related Tips and Tricks,
Some notes,
 - binary tree has tag-binary-tree and Binary Search Trees have `tag-ds-BST`
 - Other tree problem has `tag-graph-tree`
 - judges don't need te be tagged they are categorized by container directory names
