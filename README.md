### Searching on the Repository
To implement searching based on tags we added meta to each of the source file.
During search have to append `tag-` as prefix of the tag string. For example, to
search on problems on linked-list: we navigate to [this repo
url](https://github.com/atiq-cs/Problem-Solving/) and enter following in the
search box: `tag-linked-list`

Additionally, here are currently supported tags/classifications based on
algorithm and data structure,
 * [Bit Manipulation](

#### Tag related tips and tricks,
Some notes,
 - Most of the binary tree related problems are under 'recursion' tag even
 though not specified always. Some DP solutions (top-down) are recursive.
