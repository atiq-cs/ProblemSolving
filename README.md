### Searching on the Repository
To implement searching based on tags we added meta to each of the source file. During search have to append `tag-` as prefix of the tag string. For example to search on problems on linked-list: you navigate to [this repo url](https://github.com/atiq-cs/Problem-Solving/) and enter following on search box: `tag-linked-list`

Additionally, here are the currently supported tags on algo/data structure based domains,
 * [Binary Search](https://github.com/atiq-cs/Problem-Solving/search?q=tag-binary-search)
 * [Dynamic Programming](https://github.com/atiq-cs/Problem-Solving/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=tag-dynamic-programming)
 * [Linked List](https://github.com/atiq-cs/Problem-Solving/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=tag-linked-list)
