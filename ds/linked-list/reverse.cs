* Title : Reverse a Linked List
* Ref   : C.L.R.S ed3, Section 10.2, p236
* Date  : 2018-06
* Author: Atiq Rahman
* Comp  : O(N), O(1)
* Status: Accepted
* Notes : These problem has easy testcases I guess.
*   This solution will hit null pointer exception: NullReferenceException
*   when an empty or null tree is passed, i.e, []
*   [1] will work because left, right both pointing at that node and value at
*   left node won't be less than value at right node.
*   
*   C.L.R.S ref above explains operations for both singly and doubly list and
*   introduces sentinels
* meta  : tag-two-pointers, tag-ds-linked-list, tag-bst-successor, tag-bst-predecessor,

/* Consider following example for the recursive solution,
 3 -> 4 -> 5

previous node variable = null;

During first iteration,
head = 3
 current = 3
 head = 4 (next of 3)
 3 's next set to null
 previous = 3

on second iteration,
 current = 4
 head = 5
 4's next set to 3
 previous = 4

3rd iteration gives,
 current = 5
 head = null
 current's next set to 4
 previous = 5
